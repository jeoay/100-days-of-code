# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 18, 2016
###

**Today's Progress**: Used FreeCodeCamp to begin building a portfolio website. 

**Thoughts:** I have a good understanding of HTML and CSS (still a intermediate in JS) but I feel like I was struggling to put together ideas for the page. I need to be more concise with my decision making. Afterall, this is for practice.

### Day 2: January 19, 2016
###

**Today's Progress**: Started building a script in Python that creates a fantasy football draft order based on a designated percentage given to each team. 

**Thoughts:** It was slow going at first. I sat down to build the script and it was a learning experience trying to get python to run in the command line. After a few mins tinkering around I figured it out and was able to get a start on the script.

### Day 3: January 21, 2016
###

**Today's Progress**: Continued building a script in Python that creates a fantasy football draft order based on a designated percentage given to each team. Added if statement that asks whether a random number generated is equal or less than the assigned number of each position. 

**Thoughts:** Finding a way to randomly generate a number wasnt hard, but figuring out how to compare that number to the assigned numbers of each team was difficult. I would like to find a way to plug in each percentage for teams and then ask the console to pick on based on that percentage but for now I added the percentages together and gave them a range. If the random number falls in a given teams range, then it spits out that teams name.

### Day 4: January 22, 2016
###

**Today's Progress**: Used datetime method to create a script that tells you how many days until your birthday. 

**Thoughts:** I got stuck on my other project and decided to build this using code I learned from lynda.com's up and running with Python. Cool little script but basic functionality.

### Day 5: January 23, 2016
###

**Today's Progress**: Continued building portfolio with AngularJS

**Thoughts:** I had originally build my portfolio with standard html, js and css but have decided to go with AngularJS because of its lightweight functionality and mobile friendly features.

### Day 6: January 24, 2016
###

**Today's Progress**: In progress of building a to-do list that also tells me if there is enough sunlight left to do my outdoor chores. 

**Thoughts:** This was a fun one! And still isnt complete. It took a while to build so far, but I learned a ton about Python in just a few hours.
