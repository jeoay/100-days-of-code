# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 18th, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Used FreeCodeCamp to begin building a portfolio website. 

**Thoughts:** I have a good understanding of HTML and CSS (still a novice in JS) but I feel like I was struggling to put together ideas for the page. I need to be more concise with my decision making. Afterall, this is for practice.
