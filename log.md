# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 18th, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Used FreeCodeCamp to begin building a portfolio website. 

**Thoughts:** I have a good understanding of HTML and CSS (still a intermediate in JS) but I feel like I was struggling to put together ideas for the page. I need to be more concise with my decision making. Afterall, this is for practice.

**Today's Progress**: Started building a script in Python that creates a fantasy football draft order based on a designated percentage given to each team. 

**Thoughts:** It was slow going at first. I sat down to build the script and it was a learning experience trying to get python to run in the command line. After a few mins tinkering around I figured it out and was able to get a start on the script.
